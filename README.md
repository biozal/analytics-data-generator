# Data Generator 
This repo contains the item.gen.py script that is used to generate items that will be stored in the beer_item.json file.  The data format and rules are loosely based on CH3 which you can find more information about here (see page 65): https://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-c_v5.11.0.pdf

### Usage:
```python
python3 item_gen.py 
```
